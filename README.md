# Focus BI Dashboard
Based on the work by Yorek(https://github.com/yorek/ssis-dashboard) this is a dashboard to monitor SSIS packages based in the database catalog. The dashboard uses a Visual Studio 2012/15 MVC web site which can be run locally or on a server. Using the UI you can drill down to view the state of tasks, see messages or any errors. 

An online working demo can be found at: http://focusbidashboard.azurewebsites.net/
